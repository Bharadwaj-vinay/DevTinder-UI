## Routing
- **Routing** is the process of determining which component to display based on the URL.
- It allows navigation between different views in a single-page application (SPA).
- Typically implemented using a routing library like React Router, Angular Router, or Vue Router.

## Router
- The **Router** is the core component that manages the application's routes.
- It listens to URL changes and renders the appropriate components.
- Example in React Router:
    ```jsx
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';

    function App() {
        return (
            <Router>
                <Routes>
                    <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                    <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
                </Routes>
            </Router>
        );
    }
    ```

## Outlet
- The **Outlet** is a placeholder component used in nested routing.
- It renders child routes inside a parent route.
- Example:
    ```jsx
    import { Outlet } from 'react-router-dom';

    function Dashboard() {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>Dashboard</h1>
                <Outlet /> {/* Renders child routes */}
            </div>
        );
    }
    ```

## Key Points
- Use `Router` to define the application's routing structure.
- Use `Outlet` for nested routes to render child components dynamically.
- Always ensure routes are well-structured and intuitive for better user experience.
- Test routes thoroughly to avoid navigation issues.
- Use route parameters and query strings for dynamic routing when needed.
- Protect sensitive routes using authentication guards or middleware.
